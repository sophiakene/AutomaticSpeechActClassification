    "             speech acts:\n",
    "             Representative (rep): For Searle (1976: 10) the purpose of the class of representatives is 'to commit the speaker (in varying degrees) to something's being the case, to the truth of the expressed proposition'. The context of an utterance is often crucial to understanding the speaker's intent.\n",
    "             Here are three examples of representatives:\n",
    "             1) and if you 'd seen the boy was doing what donagh would 've been doing\n",
    "             2) <[> jenni <[> <{> you 're a little star\n",
    "             3) and yet the art of the storyteller is perhaps more important than ever in today 's fast-moving world\n",
    "             \n",
    "             Directive (dir): Searle (1976: 11) characterises directives as acts 'by the speaker to get the hearer to do something'. While certain verbs such as ask, order, or command obviously have canonical uses as indicators of directives, Searle (1976: 11fn.) relegates to a footnote the observation that 'questions are a species of directives, since they are attempts by S to get H to answer'.\n",
    "             Here are three examples of directives:\n",
    "             1) what do you mean you don't like it\n",
    "             2) do you know\n",
    "             3) which of the disciplines do you prefer\n",
    "\n",
    "             Commissive (com): Searle (1976: 11) understands commissives as those 'illocutionary acts whose point is to commit the speaker (again in varying degrees) to some future course of action'. Subject to the sincerity condition of having a genuine intention to carry out the action to which a commitment is made, the person who utters a commissive undertakes to fit the external world to the words which have been uttered. This definition includes both a central function of commitment and the qualification that this commitment may be expressed in varying degrees of strength. \n",
    "             Here are three examples of commissives:\n",
    "             1) i 'll be able to get somewhere then <,> get more topics going\n",
    "             2) we 'll say phone back\n",
    "             3) i 'm not going to say any more\n",
    "\n",
    "             Expressives (exp): In expressives, the purpose of an utterance is, as Searle (1976: 12) says, 'to express the psychological state specified in the sincerity condition about a state of affairs specified in the propositional content'. The key distinguishing characteristic of expressives is that 'the speaker is neither trying to get the world to match the words nor the words to match the world: the truth of the expressed proposition is presupposed'. \n",
    "             Here are three examples of expressives:\n",
    "             1) oh sorry <,> here he  i  <,> here he comes\n",
    "             2) oh <{> <[> my-god\n",
    "             3) and i 'm very proud of him  re  <,>\n",
    "             \n",
    "             Declarative (dec):  In Searle's (1976) taxonomy, successful performance of a declarative 'guarantees that the propositional content corresponds to the world' (p. 13). This guarantee arises because some aspect of the real world changes as a result of the commission of the speech act.\n",
    "             Here are three examples of declaratives:\n",
    "             1) and nothing but the truth \n",
    "             2) accordingly i reverse the order of the learned master <,> with costs here and below\n",
    "             3) swear to god\n",
    "             \n",
    "             Indeterminate conversationally-relevant utterance (icu): Indeterminate conversationally-relevant utterances denote a broad range of minimal responses, back-channel utterances, or other elements of speech which are relevant to the maintenance of discourse or discourse continuity, but which lack a discernable function as a speech act.\n",
    "             Here are three examples of Indeterminate conversationally-relevant utterances: \n",
    "             1) yeah <,,>\n",
